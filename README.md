# Hello, D3!

This is a toy Hello, World! test bed for the D3 library. 

I may grow this over time as I have the chance to play
with it. The folder structure will accomodate that expansion.

Some things I want to investigate with this project

1. Import tabular delimited text data from data folder
2. Import JSON text data from data folder
3. Import data from database connection (from my website)
4. Make interactive visual components
5. Make interactive visual update display content
6. Take user input and store that data
7. More ideas to come ... ?

I know D3 makes it easy to do some (all) of these, but the
library is largely unknown to me, so it'll be something I
can explore in my down time. Once my website is available,
I'll have a place to host this library for real tests. For 
now, this will be my code test bed.
